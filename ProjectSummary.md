# Weather Forecast SPA Project Summary

## Goals and Objectives
This project is aimed to build a single page weather forecast application using React. The app needs to have two main panels, one for adding or selecting cities and the other is for displaying weather report for the selected city.

The goals that the project needs to meet are:

    1. Type a city name in the input then click + button to call  weather endpoint to validate city name.

    2. If the city name is valid it should be added to the list below under Recent Locations. If a city is invalid an error message should appear and the city should not be added to the list.

    3. Adding a new location should be added to the top of the list.

    4. The cities in the Recent Locations list should show last temperature and the weather status (an Icon is a bonus).

    5. Click on the Refresh button should update the weather reading at this particular location.

    6. Click on X button should remove a location from the list.

    7. Click on the list item should Call a forecast API and populate right panel according to the layout.

    8. Click on the Clear button should remove all locations form the list.

    9. Only 8 locations should be added, the ninth location should be pushed to the top of the list and the one on the bottom removed.

    10. Click on the Refresh button should refresh weather forecast reading.
