# Weather Forecast SPA - Authentication Server 

This is a simple [express][express] REST server which supports validating the user via email&password pair or jtw token. The server is living on firebase cloud function service.

Everytime a user has signed in with email/password, a new generated token will be returned to the user.

## Installation

This project uses [Mongodb altas] as database. To run this server, you need to have a mongodb service running and configure the mongoose.connect to connect to your db service. 

Create a new js file functions/config/config.js and export your mongbe connection string and a secret key string for jwt. 

The default way to create an express app was also changed in order to make this project deployable to firebase cloud functions.


### To run it as a normal express app.
Change:
```javascript
exports.app = functions.https.onRequest(app);
```
To:
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3090;
const server = createServer(app);
server.listen(port);
```
Install the dependencies and start the app.
<br>

```sh
$ cd functions
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```
### To run it on firebase cloud function service.

Make sure you have firebase CLI installed.
```sh
$ firebase init
```
To connect to your firebase app.
Edit the firebase.json file to bind the sources to app function.
```sh
$ firebase deploy --only functions
```
To deploy your express app to firebase cloud function service.
